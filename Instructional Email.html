    <p>Hi <?= lodgeName ?> Team</p>
    <p><br>We here at <a href="https://pacificnetandtwine.com/">Pacific Net & Twine</a> are excited to invite you to use our brand new <a href=<?= pntOrderFormURL ?>>PNT Order Form</a>. It is a spreadsheet that you can access anywhere, anytime, through your computer's web browser. The document is created using Google Sheets and further augmented with computer code written by myself, Jarren Ralf, Data Specialist at PNT. You can also download the Google Sheet application and view this spreadsheet from your smart phone. Unfortunately, the app does not allow the background use of scripts, so you aren't able to build orders from your phone at this time, but you can still view everything and search for items on the <i>Item Search</i>. Our goal was to both, save you time submitting orders, while saving ourselves time importing them. We believe that we have solved that problem, and hope that your ordering experience will be enhanced using this tool.</p>
    <p>Within this email, I intend to explain in depth all of the features of the <a href=<?= pntOrderFormURL ?>>PNT Order Form</a>, and how to use it in 5 easy steps. Please pin or save this email so that you can reference the information below while you are learning to use our platform.</p>
    <p><b>If you are experiencing a pop-up that says <i>Authorization required</i>, then scroll to the buttom of this email to find instructions for proceeding.</b></p>
    <p>The first preliminary step to using this spreadsheet is to <a href=<?= createGoogleAccountURL ?>>create a Google account</a>, if you don't already have one. If you don't have one, I want to make it clear that I am not refering to creating a Gmail email account. A Google account can be signed up for using <i>ANY</i> email of your choice. You may also share that email and password with other people in your organization as well. Creating a Google account is a necessary step for us to manage the security of this spreadsheet for our mutual benefit.</p>
    <p><b><i>Step 1:</i> First, begin by entering your purchase order number, delivery / pick up date and location.</b></p>
    <img src="cid:1" alt="PO and Delivery Instructions">
    <p><b><i>Step 2:</i> Search for Items.</b> If you want to view every item that we have in our system, you may click on the All Items button. This will display every item, where the most recently created items appear at the top of the list.</p>
    <img src="cid:2" alt="Display All Items">
    <p>If you want to narrow down the list, you can search for items using word or word fragments in the top left corner of the spreadsheet.</p>
    <img src="cid:3" alt="Search for Items">
    <p>You are able to compute multiple searches simultaneously if you type the keyword word "OR" in the search bar followed by addditional search words.</p>
    <img src="cid:4" alt="Search for Items Using OR">
    <p>If there are items that show up that you want removed from the results of your search then you may add the "NOT" keyword to your search and then type words or word fragments that you want eliminated.</p>
    <img src="cid:5" alt="Search for Items Using NOT">
    <p>We are thrilled to present the following features of this spreadsheet to you. Your  spreadsheet contains a year-to-date <a href=<?= velocityReportURL ?>>velocity report</a> of the total quantity and amount of a particular item that you have purchased from us each year, all the way back to 2012. In addition, all of your <a href=<?= invoiceDataURL ?>>past invoices</a> dating back to 2012 are also shared. We encourage you to use this information to help you more easily build and submit additional orders with us. <b>For example, you can copy and paste any of the item numbers found in the <a href=<?= velocityReportURL ?>>Yearly Purchase Report</a> directly into your search box in order to find the desired products quickly and precisely.</b></p>
    <img src="cid:6" alt="Past Invoices Yearly Data and Chart">
    <p><b><i>Step 3:</i> Add Items to your Order.</b> Once you find some items that you want, then select the items and click the "Add Selected Items to Order" button, as shown below.</p>
    <img src="cid:7" alt="Add Selected Items to Order">
    <p><b><i>Step 4:</i> Add Comments to your Order. Remember to add comments to your order whenever necessary.</b> Occasionally, some item descriptions do not specify the colour of the product for example, type your desired colour scheme to the right of the product description.</p>
    <p>We should also point out that we invite you to free type in the <i>Description</i> field and the <i>Item / General Order Notes</i> field with any questions, comments or concerns you have. If you have detailed instructions, share as much information as you can. Can't find an item in our catalogue but still want to inquire about it? Just describe the item in the <i>Description</i> field. Need us to place a special order for you? Type it out in the <i>Description</i> or the <i>Item / General Order Notes</i> column.</p>
    <img src="cid:8" alt="Adding Item Comments">
    <p><b>Need to remove items?</b> If there are any items on your order that you would like to delete, then select them and press the delete key, as shown below.</p>
    <img src="cid:9" alt="Deleting Items">
    <p>A general rule that you can follow when using this spreadsheet is that you are expected to edit any cell of the spreadsheet that has a white background. Please try to avoid changing the grey and colour cells. In  a few cases the system will not allow you to type in them, but in others, a warning sign will pop up. Whenever you see this warning, please <b>click Cancel</b> everytime. If you fail to click cancel, then don't worry, our system will be able to handle the situation.</p>
    <img src="cid:10" alt="Click Cancel On Warning Box">
    <p><b><i>Step 5:</i> Submit your Order.</b> The only exception to the rule above is that when you want to submit an order, you must click the checkbox at the top of the page where it says "Submit Order: (Click Checkbox)". When you make that selection, you should receive a confirmation email. We will also receive one. Once a pop window confirms that your order has been submitted then you are ready to begin building your next order immediately.</p>
    <img src="cid:11" alt="Submit Order">
    <p><b>Authorization required? Follow these steps.</b> In order to use this spreadsheet, you must do a one-time protocol of authorizing the script that runs when you click on the "All Items" and "Add Selected Items to Order" buttons.</a> Google is warning you against authorizing the script because it was not their company that created it, it was me, Jarren at PNT. It is perfectly safe to authorize the script. If you have any questions or concerns about this process, please contact me through email and I will be happy to fully explain the situation.</p>
    <img src="cid:12" alt="Authorizing_Script">
    <p>Two final notes about our spreadsheet is that the item list, <a href=<?= invoiceDataURL ?>>past invoice</a> information, and <a href=<?= velocityReportURL ?>>velocity report</a> will be updated daily. You will always have the most up to date information that our programs are able to provide you. Finally, to protect our privacy and yours, we ask that you do <b>not</b> distribute this spreadsheet outside of your organization. This spreadsheet will only be available for viewing and editting by those who have been invited by PNT to use it. As editors of this spreadsheet, you have authorization to send an invite link to more people. An automated script will run every hour of every single day removing these emails from being able to view or edit the spreadsheet. If you need more people in your company to access this spreadsheet, you have two options. Option one is to provide those individuals with the sign-in information of one of the authorized Google accounts that already have edit access to the spreadsheet. Option two would be for those employees to create their own Google account(s) and then have the primary correspondant of your company contact us giving permission for that specific email address(es) to access the spreadsheet. If we do not have their emails in our records, then they will not be able to remain as editors.</p>
    <p>That concludes our instructions for the <a href=<?= pntOrderFormURL ?>>PNT Order Form</a>. If you have any technical questions about the spreadsheet more broadly, then please don't hesitate to send me an email. We encourage and welcome any feedback from you.</p>
    <p>Thank You</p>
